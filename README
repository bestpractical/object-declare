NAME
    Object::Declare - Declarative object constructor

SYNOPSIS
        use Object::Declare ['MyApp::Column', 'MyApp::Param'];

        my $objects = declare {

        param foo =>
            is immutable,
            valid_values are qw( more values );

        column bar =>
            field1 is 'value',
            field2 is 'some_other_value';

        };

        print $objects->{foo}; # a MyApp::Param object
        print $objects->{bar}; # a MyApp::Column object

DESCRIPTION
    This module exports one function, "declare", for building named objects
    with a declarative syntax, similar to how Jifty::DBI::Schema defines its
    columns.

    Using a flexible "import" interface, one can change exported helper
    functions names (*declarator*), words to link labels and values together
    (*copula*), and the table of named classes to declare (*mapping*):

        use Object::Declare
            declarator  => 'declare',       # this is the default
            copula      => ['is', 'are'],   # this is the default
            mapping     => {
                column => 'MyApp::Column',
                param  => 'MyApp::Param',
            };

    After the declarator block finishes execution, all helper functions are
    removed from the package. Same-named functions (such as &is and &are)
    that existed before the declarator's execution are restored correctly.
