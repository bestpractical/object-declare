=head1 NAME

Object::Declare - Declarative object constructor

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Object::Declare ['MyApp::Column', 'MyApp::Param'];

    my %objects = declare {

    param foo =>
       !is global,
        is immutable,
        valid_values are qw( more values );

    column bar =>
        field1 is 'value',
        field2 is 'some_other_value';

    };

    print $objects{foo}; # a MyApp::Param object
    print $objects{bar}; # a MyApp::Column object

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module exports one function, C<declare>, for building named
objects with a declarative syntax, similar to how L<Jifty::DBI::Schema>
defines its columns.

In list context, C<declare> returns a list of name/object pairs in the
order of declaration (allowing duplicates), suitable for putting into a hash.
In scalar context, C<declare> returns a hash reference.

Using a flexible C<import> interface, one can change exported helper
functions names (I<declarator>), words to link labels and values together
(I<copula>), and the table of named classes to declare (I<mapping>):

    use Object::Declare
        declarator  => ['declare'],     # list of declarators
        copula      => {                # list of words, or a map
            is  => '',                  #  from copula to prefixes for
            are => '',                  #  labels built with that copula
        }
        mapping     => {
            column => 'MyApp::Column',  # class name to call ->new to
            param  => sub {             # arbitrary coderef also works
                bless(\@_, 'MyApp::Param');
            },
        };

After the declarator block finishes execution, all helper functions are
removed from the package.  Same-named functions (such as C<&is> and C<&are>)
that existed before the declarator's execution are restored correctly.

=head1 NOTES

If you export the declarator to another package via C<@EXPORT>, be sure 
to export all mapping keys as well.  For example, this will work for the
example above:

    our @EXPORT = qw( declare column param );

But this will not:

    our @EXPORT = qw( declare );

The copula are not turned into functions, so there is no need to export them.
