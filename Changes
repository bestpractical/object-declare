[Changes for 0.05 - 2006-07-17]

* Support for ordered declarations, via list-context return of 
  "declare".  In scalar context, it still returns a hash reference.

[Changes for 0.04 - 2006-07-17]

* Support for plural values via "are":

    column x =>
        field1 is 'xxx',
        field2 are 'XXX', 'XXX', # <-- Plural value
        is field3;

[Changes for 0.03 - 2006-07-17]

* The declarator can now be exported to another package;
  this works because internally, each declarator remembers
  the class mappings and copula it was associated with.

[Changes for 0.02 - 2006-07-17]

* Documentation cleanup; no functional changes.

[Changes for 0.01 - 2006-07-17]

* Initial CPAN release.
